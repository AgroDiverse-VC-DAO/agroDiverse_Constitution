# Constitution of the AgroDiverse Venture Fund (AVF)

> ### **Preamble**
> We, the global community of investors, engineers, and allies, establish the AgroDiverse Venture Fund (AVF) to democratize access to diversified cryptocurrency investments, foster wealth creation through blockchain-backed indices, and strengthen economic ties across borders. Guided by principles of transparency, inclusivity, and innovation, AVF leverages multi-chain cryptocurrencies and DAO governance to provide exposure to a managed crypto basket. This constitution outlines the fund’s structure, governance, operations, and dispute resolution mechanisms to ensure fairness, accountability, and universal participation.

## **Article I: Purpose and Mission**

**Purpose:**
> AVF exists to provide accessible, diversified exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies via the AVF token, with a focus on stability, growth, and emerging DeFi utilities, while empowering members through decentralized governance.

**Mission:**
- Manage a crypto index backed by major and specialized tokens, emphasizing diversification across networks.
- Create wealth for global investors through tokenized ownership, asset appreciation, and potential yields.
- Build a connected investor ecosystem by enabling participation in governance and fund decisions.
- Operate transparently via blockchain, ensuring trust and accountability for all participants.

**Core Values:**
- **Inclusivity:** Enable participation from retail and institutional investors worldwide.
- **Transparency:** Record all transactions and decisions on-chain for public auditability.
- **Empowerment:** Prioritize strategies with economic impact, such as diversified growth and yield generation.
- **Innovation:** Leverage multi-chain DeFi and blockchain to bypass traditional financial gatekeepers.

---

## **Article II: Fund Structure**

**Legal Status:**
- AVF operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Vaulta Network, using on-chain voting to select delegates.
- The fund complies with applicable regulations by issuing utility tokens (AVF tokens) that grant governance rights but do not constitute securities or investment contracts. AVF token is a requirement for governance participation.

**Tokenized Ownership:**
- AVF issues AVF tokens as native ERC-223 tokens on Ethereum, representing participation in the fund's crypto basket. Tokens are fully decentralized, tradeable on decentralized exchanges (e.g., DEX223), and confer voting rights in the DAO.
- Tokens are divisible, enabling fractional participation to lower entry barriers (e.g., $10 minimum contribution).

**Asset Management:**

| Asset         | Network         | Allocation |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| BTC          | Bitcoin        | 30%        |
| ETH          | Ethereum       | 10%        |
| XRP          | XRP Ledger     | 5%         |
| SOL          | Solana         | 5%         |
| D223         | Ethereum       | 20%        |
| XLM          | Stellar        | 5%         |
| Other Tokens | (DAO-selected) | 25%        |

- Assets are held in multi-chain treasury wallets managed manually by the Treasury Team, with public addresses for transparency. Monitoring uses tools like Portfolio Watch for balance tallying.

**Multi-Chain Operations:**
- AVF operates across Ethereum (for AVF token), Vaulta (for governance), Bitcoin, XRP Ledger, Solana, and Stellar to ensure global accessibility and efficiency.
- Cross-chain bridges and oracles enable seamless visibility and data integration for governance.

---

## **Article III: Membership and Participation**

**Eligibility:**
- Membership is open to any individual or entity worldwide who acquires AVF tokens through funding rounds or DEX purchases, creates a Vaulta account, and donates A tokens (Vaulta's native token) worth $100 USD.
- No geographic, cultural, or financial restrictions apply, promoting outreach to diverse global communities.

**Onboarding:**
1. Create a Vaulta account.
2. Donate A tokens via smart contract.
3. Contribute to funding rounds (e.g., ETH, USDC) on Ethereum.
4. Receive a welcome kit with guides on multi-chain wallets, DeFi, and DAO participation (available in multiple languages).
5. Yearly membership dues of $100 USD in A are required to become eligible for governance candidacy, deducted automatically via smart contract.

**Global Accessibility:**
- AVF partners with international networks to conduct workshops on blockchain literacy in underserved regions.
- The platform supports mobile access and low-bandwidth interfaces to accommodate users in regions with limited internet access.

**Investor Incentives:**
- Early contributors receive valuable NFT badges with special privileges that will be unlocked in the future.
- Token holders earn potential yields from the basket (e.g., staking), distributed quarterly as stablecoins.

---

## **Article IV: Governance**

**DAO Structure:**
- AVF is governed by a DAO on the Vaulta Network, where AVF token holders elect delegates via political playoffs (a multi-round competitive election process with nominations, primaries, and finals). All governance structure and rules will be coded as a ricardian contract on the Vaulta blockchain.

**Decision-Making:**
- Proposals (e.g., fundraising rounds, treasury rebalancing, basket token additions) are discussed by delegates with members and founders, then if agreed upon, voted on with AVF tokens, requiring a 51% majority with a 10% quorum.
- Voting occurs on-chain through a secure, audited platform, with a 7-day period for major decisions.
- Emergency proposals require a 75% supermajority and a 48-hour voting period.

**Delegates:**
- Delegates screen and propose decisions, with expertise in blockchain, finance, or engineering disclosed on-chain (on delegates' NFT profile).
- Delegates receive a monthly stipend from the smart contract, claimable on-chain, for their work.
- Delegate decisions are advisory; final approval rests with token holders via vote.

**Transparency:**
- All proposals, votes, and financial transactions are recorded on-chain and publicly accessible via a blockchain explorer.
- Quarterly reports detail fund performance, basket status, and community impact, published in multiple languages.

---

## **Article V: Portfolio Operations**

**Portfolio Strategy:**
- AVF maintains the specified crypto basket allocation, with rebalancing quarterly or as voted to address market drifts.
- At least 25% of the "other tokens" allocation prioritizes emerging or utility-focused assets to foster diversification.

**Portfolio Process:**
- Capital from funding rounds is manually allocated by the Treasury Team (key engineers and founders) to purchase basket assets.
- Quarterly funding rounds issue AVF at a price snapshot from DEX223 Exchange; extra rounds require DAO vote.
- Due diligence on new tokens (for addition) is published on-chain.

**Instruments:**
- Assets are held natively on their networks; yields (e.g., staking) are captured via DeFi protocols where applicable.
- Purchases ensure predictable backing, with manual execution for security.

**Support Services:**
- AVF allocates an annual budget from dues/yields for community initiatives, such as blockchain education or tool development.

**Returns Distribution:**
> **Note:** Profits from asset appreciation or yields are distributed as stablecoins to token holders, proportional to holdings.
> - 20% of profits are reinvested into the basket
> - 10% fund DAO operations
> - 70% are distributed to investors

## **Article VI: Dispute Resolution**

**Principles:**
- Disputes (e.g., governance conflicts, rebalancing disagreements, smart contract issues) are resolved transparently, fairly, and decentrally to maintain trust.
- Resolution prioritizes mediation and community input over centralized arbitration.

**Dispute Resolution Process:**
1. **Mediation:**
   - Parties submit disputes to a Mediation Council, composed of 3 neutral token holders randomly selected.
   - Mediators facilitate dialogue and propose solutions within 14 days.
2. **DAO Arbitration:**
   - If mediation fails, disputes escalate to a DAO vote. Token holders review evidence and vote on a resolution within 7 days.
   - A 51% majority is required to finalize the decision, which is binding and enforced.

**Smart Contract Disputes:**
- Bugs or hacks are addressed by a Security Council of 3 blockchain experts, elected annually by token holders.
- The Security Council can pause smart contracts for up to 72 hours to mitigate risks, pending a DAO vote for permanent changes.
- Audits by reputable firms (e.g., Certik, OpenZeppelin) are conducted biannually to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Appeals:**
- Parties may appeal DAO arbitration decisions within 7 days, requiring a new vote with a 75% supermajority to overturn.
- Appeals are limited to one per dispute to prevent abuse.

**Transparency:**
- All dispute proceedings, evidence, and outcomes are recorded on-chain and accessible to token holders.
- Anonymous summaries are published to protect privacy while ensuring accountability.

## **Article VII: Risk Mitigation**

**Crypto Volatility:**
- Diversification across the basket mitigates risks; optional hedging with DeFi derivatives (e.g., options) for 10% of assets.
- Quarterly rebalancing ensures alignment with target allocations.

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- AVF tokens are utility tokens, avoiding securities classification by granting governance rights without profit expectations.
- The fund engages legal experts to monitor regulations in key jurisdictions (e.g., U.S., EU, Asia-Pacific) and allocates 2% of assets for compliance costs.

**Tech Literacy:**
- AVF will partner and offer free online courses and in-person workshops globally to educate investors on multi-chain ops and DeFi.
- A multilingual helpdesk supports users via chat, email, and community forums.

**Market Competition:**
- AVF focuses on unique basket composition and DAO governance for differentiated exposure, leveraging networks like DEX223 for liquidity.

## **Article VIII: Amendments**

**Proposal Process:**
- Any token holder may propose amendments via the DAO governance platform.
- Chief delegates will vote on the amendments and then discuss with founders. If approved, the ricardian contract will be updated and signed by key holders so all DAO members can verify the amendments on the blockchain.

**Approval:**
- Amendments require 2/3 + 1 for approval.
- Approved amendments after being verified with founders (or delegates elected by founders) and blockchain security experts of AVF are coded, and implemented via smart contract updates, audited before deployment.

**Review:**
- The constitution is reviewed annually by elected delegates, then discussed with founders of AVF and its blockchain security team. Recommendations for updates if approved are submitted to AVF developers to code and implement changes.

---

## **Article IX: Dissolution**

**Conditions:**
- AVF may dissolve if approved by 2/3+1 of delegates and discussed with founders (or delegates elected by founders) of AVF.
- Dissolution triggers a wind-down process to liquidate assets and distribute proceeds.

**Wind-Down Process:**
- Assets are converted to stablecoins and distributed to token holders proportional to their holdings of AVF tokens.
- Final financials are published on-chain, and the DAO is archived.

---

## **Article X: Community Engagement**

**Outreach:**
- AVF partners with international organizations and tech communities to promote the fund and attract investors.
- Annual virtual and in-person summits discuss portfolio performance and innovations.

**Impact Measurement:**
- AVF tracks metrics such as asset growth, yield generation, and member participation, reported annually to token holders.
- An annual budget supports impact initiatives, such as DeFi education programs.

**Global Empowerment:**
- The fund prioritizes basket additions promoting sustainable development and cross-cultural collaboration.
