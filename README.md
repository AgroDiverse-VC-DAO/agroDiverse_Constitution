### Constitution of the AgroDiverse Venture Fund (AVF)

#### Preamble

We, the global community of investors, engineers, and allies, establish the AgroDiverse Venture Fund (AVF) to democratize access to diversified cryptocurrency investments, foster wealth creation through blockchain-backed indices, and strengthen economic ties across borders. Guided by principles of transparency, inclusivity, and innovation, AVF leverages multi-chain cryptocurrencies and DAO governance to provide exposure to a managed crypto basket. This constitution outlines the fund’s structure, governance, operations, and dispute resolution mechanisms to ensure fairness, accountability, and universal participation.

---

### Article I: Purpose and Mission

**Purpose:** AVF exists to provide accessible, diversified exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies via the AVF token, with a focus on stability, growth, and emerging DeFi utilities, while empowering members through decentralized governance.

**Mission:**
- To manage a crypto index backed by major and specialized tokens, emphasizing diversification across networks.
- To create wealth for global investors through tokenized ownership, asset appreciation, and potential yields.
- To build a connected investor ecosystem by enabling participation in governance and fund decisions.
- To operate transparently via blockchain, ensuring trust and accountability for all participants.

**Core Values:**
- **Inclusivity:** Enable participation from retail and institutional investors worldwide.
- **Transparency:** Record all transactions and decisions on-chain for public auditability.
- **Empowerment:** Prioritize strategies with economic impact, such as diversified growth and yield generation.
- **Innovation:** Leverage multi-chain DeFi and blockchain to bypass traditional financial gatekeepers.

---

### Article II: Fund Structure

**Legal Status:**
- AVF operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Vaulta Network, using on-chain voting to select delegates.
- The fund complies with applicable regulations by issuing utility tokens (AVF tokens) that grant governance rights but do not constitute securities or investment contracts. AVF token is a requirement for governance participation. 

**Tokenized Ownership:**
- AVF issues AVF tokens as native ERC-223 tokens on Ethereum, representing participation in the fund's crypto basket. Tokens are fully decentralized, tradeable on decentralized exchanges (e.g., DEX223), and confer voting rights in the DAO.
- Tokens are divisible, enabling fractional participation to lower entry barriers (e.g., $10 minimum contribution).

**Asset Management:**
- The fund allocates capital as follows: 30% in BTC (Bitcoin network), 10% in ETH (Ethereum network), 5% in XRP (XRP Ledger), 5% in SOL (Solana network), 20% in D223 (Ethereum), 5% in XLM (Stellar network), and 25% in other tokens (selected via DAO governance, e.g., stablecoins or emerging utilities).
- Assets are held in multi-chain treasury wallets managed manually by the Treasury Team, with public addresses for transparency. Monitoring uses tools like Portfolio Watch for balance tallying.

**Multi-Chain Operations:**
- AVF operates across Ethereum (for AVF token), Vaulta (for governance), Bitcoin, XRP Ledger, Solana, and Stellar to ensure global accessibility and efficiency.
- Cross-chain bridges and oracles enable seamless visibility and data integration for governance.

---

### Article III: Membership and Participation

**Eligibility:**
- Membership is open to any individual or entity worldwide who acquires AVF tokens through funding rounds or DEX purchases, creates a Vaulta account, and donates A tokens (Vaulta's native token) worth $100 USD.
- No geographic, cultural, or financial restrictions apply, promoting outreach to diverse global communities.

**Onboarding:**
- Participants with AVF tokens who wants to be elected delegates join by creating a Vaulta account, donating A tokens via smart contract, and contributing to funding rounds (e.g., ETH, USDC) on Ethereum.
- New members receive a welcome kit with guides on multi-chain wallets, DeFi, and DAO participation, available in multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic).
- Yearly membership dues of $100 USD in A are required to become eligible for being a candidate to be elected for governance, deducted automatically via smart contract to sustain the DAO.

**Global Accessibility:**
- AVF partners with international networks to conduct workshops on blockchain literacy in underserved regions.
- The platform supports mobile access and low-bandwidth interfaces to accommodate users in regions with limited internet access.

**Investor Incentives:**
- Early contributors receive valuable NFT badges with special privileges that will be unlocked in the future.
- Token holders earn potential yields from the basket (e.g., staking), distributed quarterly as stablecoins.

---

### Article IV: Governance

**DAO Structure:**
- AVF is governed by a DAO on the Vaulta Network, where AVF token holders elect delegates via political playoffs (a multi-round competitive election process with nominations, primaries, and finals). All governance structure and rules will be coded as a ricardian contract on the Vaulta blockchain.

**Decision-Making:**
- Proposals (e.g., fundraising rounds, treasury rebalancing, basket token additions) are discussed by delegates with members and founders, then if agreed upon, voted on with AVF tokens, requiring a 51% majority with a 10% quorum.
- Voting occurs on-chain through a secure, audited platform, with a 7-day period for major decisions.
- Emergency proposals require a 75% supermajority and a 48-hour voting period.

**Delegates:**

- Delegates receive a monthly stipend from the smart contract, claimable on-chain, for their work.
- Delegate decisions are advisory; final approval rests with token holders via vote.

**Transparency:**
- All proposals, votes, and financial transactions are recorded on-chain and publicly accessible via a blockchain explorer.
- Quarterly reports detail fund performance, basket status, and community impact, published in multiple languages.

---

### Article V: Portfolio Operations

**Portfolio Strategy:**
- AVF maintains the specified crypto basket allocation, with rebalancing quarterly or as voted to address market drifts.
- At least 25% of the "other tokens" allocation prioritizes emerging or utility-focused assets to foster diversification.

**Portfolio Process:**
- Capital from funding rounds is manually allocated by the Treasury Team (key engineers and founders) to purchase basket assets.
- Quarterly funding rounds issue AVF at a price snapshot from DEX223 Exchange; extra rounds require DAO vote.
- Due diligence on new tokens (for addition) is published on-chain.

**Instruments:**
- Assets are held natively on their networks; yields (e.g., staking) are captured via DeFi protocols where applicable.
- Purchases ensure predictable backing, with manual execution for security.

**Support Services:**
- AVF allocates an annual budget from dues/yields for community initiatives, such as blockchain education or tool development.

**Returns Distribution:**

### Article II: Fund Structure

**Legal Status:**
- AVF operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Vaulta Network, using on-chain voting to select delegates.
- The fund complies with applicable regulations by issuing utility tokens (AVF tokens) that grant governance rights but do not constitute securities or investment contracts. AVF token is a requirement for governance participation. 

**Tokenized Ownership:**
- AVF issues AVF tokens as native ERC-223 tokens on Ethereum, representing participation in the fund's crypto basket. Tokens are fully decentralized, tradeable on decentralized exchanges (e.g., DEX223), and confer voting rights in the DAO.
- Tokens are divisible, enabling fractional participation to lower entry barriers (e.g., $10 minimum contribution).

**Asset Management:**
- The fund allocates capital as follows: 30% in BTC (Bitcoin network), 10% in ETH (Ethereum network), 5% in XRP (XRP Ledger), 5% in SOL (Solana network), 20% in D223 (Ethereum), 5% in XLM (Stellar network), and 25% in other tokens (selected via DAO governance, e.g., stablecoins or emerging utilities).
- Assets are held in multi-chain treasury wallets managed manually by the Treasury Team, with public addresses for transparency. Monitoring uses tools like Portfolio Watch for balance tallying.

**Multi-Chain Operations:**
- AVF operates across Ethereum (for AVF token), Vaulta (for governance), Bitcoin, XRP Ledger, Solana, and Stellar to ensure global accessibility and efficiency.
- Cross-chain bridges and oracles enable seamless visibility and data integration for governance.

---

### Article III: Membership and Participation

**Eligibility:**
- Membership is open to any individual or entity worldwide who acquires AVF tokens through funding rounds or DEX purchases, creates a Vaulta account, and donates A tokens (Vaulta's native token) worth $100 USD.
- No geographic, cultural, or financial restrictions apply, promoting outreach to diverse global communities.

**Onboarding:**
- Participants with AVF tokens who wants to be elected delegates join by creating a Vaulta account, donating A tokens via smart contract, and contributing to funding rounds (e.g., ETH, USDC) on Ethereum.
- New members receive a welcome kit with guides on multi-chain wallets, DeFi, and DAO participation, available in multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic).
- Yearly membership dues of $100 USD in A are required to become eligible for being a candidate to be elected for governance, deducted automatically via smart contract to sustain the DAO.

**Global Accessibility:**
- AVF partners with international networks to conduct workshops on blockchain literacy in underserved regions.
- The platform supports mobile access and low-bandwidth interfaces to accommodate users in regions with limited internet access.

**Investor Incentives:**
- Early contributors receive valuable NFT badges with special privileges that will be unlocked in the future.
- Token holders earn potential yields from the basket (e.g., staking), distributed quarterly as stablecoins.

---

### Article IV: Governance

**DAO Structure:**
- AVF is governed by a DAO on the Vaulta Network, where AVF token holders elect delegates via political playoffs (a multi-round competitive election process with nominations, primaries, and finals). All governance structure and rules will be coded as a ricardian contract on the Vaulta blockchain.

**Decision-Making:**
- Proposals (e.g., fundraising rounds, treasury rebalancing, basket token additions) are discussed by delegates with members and founders, then if agreed upon, voted on with AVF tokens, requiring a 51% majority with a 10% quorum.
- Voting occurs on-chain through a secure, audited platform, with a 7-day period for major decisions.
- Emergency proposals require a 75% supermajority and a 48-hour voting period.

**Delegates:**

**Transparency:**
- All proposals, votes, and financial transactions are recorded on-chain and publicly accessible via a blockchain explorer.
- Quarterly reports detail fund performance, basket status, and community impact, published in multiple languages.

---

### Article V: Portfolio Operations

**Portfolio Strategy:**
- AVF maintains the specified crypto basket allocation, with rebalancing quarterly or as voted to address market drifts.
- At least 25% of the "other tokens" allocation prioritizes emerging or utility-focused assets to foster diversification.

**Portfolio Process:**
- Capital from funding rounds is manually allocated by the Treasury Team (key engineers and founders) to purchase basket assets.
- Quarterly funding rounds issue AVF at a price snapshot from DEX223 Exchange; extra rounds require DAO vote.
- Due diligence on new tokens (for addition) is published on-chain.

**Instruments:**
